## Hot-Death-Uno-Redux
This is an active revival of Hot Death Uno that includes **21 new cards** and counting, providing a thrilling Uno experience unlike any before. The Hot Death Uno Redux Constitution is an elaborate document that outlines all of the features of this new way to play the game.

For those of you unfamiliar with the original Hot Death Uno, it is a more "adult" version of Uno developed by "someone with a sick sense of humour and way too much time on his hands" (Dameon Welch, https://phoneboy.com/hdu), a sentiment very fitting of myself.

For those of you familiar with the original Hot Death Uno, this version casts aside the "point system" in favor of cohesive tabletop gameplay, but makes up for the subsequent loss of complexity with its host of new cards.

This repository hosts the PDF of the latest Constitution in PDF format. The PDF contains hyperlinks, but viewing in GitHub does not support them. Hot Death Uno Redux v3 is being play-tested for unforeseen edge-cases, so expect updates with fixes soon.

Hot Death Uno Redux is not affiliated with Uno or Mattel.
